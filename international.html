                <p>Yemen's civil war started in 2014 when Houthi rebels took over the nation's capital, Sana'a, 
                with the help of soldiers loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. They proceeded to capture 
                control of other regions of the country (United Nations Office for the Coordination of 
                Humanitarian Affairs, n.d.). In order to reinstate President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi's 
                internationally recognized government in Yemen, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia supported by a 
                number of Arab and Gulf states initiated a military intervention in March of 2015. Hence, started 
                the civil war of Yemen that is now still ongoing in the present. With sporadic fighting between 
                Houthi rebels and forces aligned with the internationally recognized government. Despite various 
                attempts at ceasefire agreements and peace talks, including UN-mediated negotiations, a lasting 
                political settlement remains elusive. The conflict has become increasingly complex, with multiple 
                actors involved and overlapping conflicts exacerbating the situation. The war has led to thousands 
                of civilian casualties, widespread displacement, and a collapse of basic services, including 
                healthcare, education, and sanitation. Yemen also faces a dire humanitarian situation, with millions 
                of people at risk of famine and disease outbreaks, exacerbated by restrictions on humanitarian 
                access and the blockade of ports. The UN Security Council has adopted several resolutions related 
                to Yemen, calling for an end to the fighting, respect for international humanitarian law, and the 
                protection of civilians (United Nations Security Council, 2015).</p>

                <p>Ukrainian officials declared in the fall of 2021 that 100,000 Russian troops had been 
                deployed close to Ukraine’s border. The Russian army attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022, as 
                attacks from the Russian army were reported amongst the major cities of Ukraine; the cities 
                affected include Berdyansk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, and the capital, Kyiv. Ten 
                thousand five hundred eighty-two civilian deaths were reported, according to The Office of the 
                United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as of February 2024 (Statista, 
                2024). As a result, most nations responded to support and aid Ukraine, as the United States, 
                becoming the country's most prominent military aid ally, has aided Ukraine, amounting to a total 
                of €67.7 billion. Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and Denmark have also been 
                committed to aiding Ukraine (Armstrong, 2024). In the proceeding time, Russia still controls 18% 
                of the nation. However, Ukraine has reclaimed 54% of the land it formerly held two years after its 
                full-scale assault. Over 30,000 civilians suffered deaths as a result of warfare and airstrikes, and 
                6.5 million have fled Ukraine. Additionally, 3.7 million people are forced to flee the country. There 
                are 14.6 million individuals in need of humanitarian aid. (Global Conflict Tracker, 2024).</p>
