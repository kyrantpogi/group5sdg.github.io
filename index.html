                    <p>The 16th Sustainable Development Goal or SDG 16 is the Peace, Justice, and Strong  Institutions goal of the United Nations (UN). It focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive  societies, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive  institutions at all levels (Martin, 2023). There are three main components under this SDG: Peace,  Justice, and Strong Institutions. First of all, the first component, Peace, seeks to promote peaceful  and inclusive societies where people are free from fear of violence by reducing violence,  combating organized crime, and ensuring access to justice for all. Second is justice, which is  crucial for sustainable development as it ensures everyone can exercise their rights and defend  themselves when needed. This component of SDG 16 aims to promote the rule of law, ensure equal  access to legal services, and strengthen institutions responsible for justice and human rights  (Asako, 2019). Finally, Strong Institutions; this component of SDG 16 emphasizes the importance  of good governance, anti-corruption measures, and inclusive decision-making processes to ensure  that the services being served are the services that are needed by the people (World Bank Group,  2023).<p>
